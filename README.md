# ai teaches golang (AI-Assisted GoLang Learning Journey)

This repository documents my journey of learning Go (Golang) with the assistance of AI tools like Perplexity. It contains various small projects and code samples that demonstrate different aspects of Go programming.

## Projects

### 1. Go Todo CLI

A simple command-line todo list application demonstrating basic Go concepts like structs, slices, and user input handling.
